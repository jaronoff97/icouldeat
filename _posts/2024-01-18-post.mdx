This was a very tough week. I made some good food to keep me comforted in this hard time.

# Risotto

Using allll the stock I made, it was time to make lots of risotto. This was the [pressure cooker vegan risotto](https://www.seriouseats.com/pressure-cooker-miso-risotto-recipe) from seriouseats. While the risotto was going, I sauteed some mushrooms, and separately braised and sauteed broccoli rabe with plenty of salt and pepper.

## Risotto pancake

Using these leftovers, I cooked down the risotto in a cast iron skillet until both sides were plenty browned. Once that was done, I topped with lots of chives and pickled peppers. I also added some lemondrop hot sauce which really made it incredible.

# Coconut Almond Cake

This was a [great recipe from Alicia Kennedy](https://www.aliciakennedy.news/p/from-the-kitchen-coconut-almond-cake), instead of the vanilla and almond extract I added some homemade pandan extract which paired really nicely with all the coconut flavor.

# Tteokbokki

Another easy vegan dish, I took the frozen rice cakes, braised them in soy sauce, lots of gochujang and gochugaru, some sake, etc. I topped the cakes with some crispy curly kale and lots of sesame.

# Makhani Take Two

Okay this was probably the best makhani sauce I've made yet. I'm going to try and recall the general amounts of things I did, because it was a lot:
* 1 tbsp kashmiri chili powder
* .5 tbsp smoked paprika
* .5 tbsp paprika
* 1 tbsp garam masala
* .5 tsp black salt powder

I also toasted and ground:
* 2 tbsp cumin seeds
* 1 tbsp coriander seeds
* 1 star anise
* 3 cloves
* 3 green cardamom

I sauteed some diced shallot and onion in some vegan butter, and on the side I fried grated garlic and ginger in some coconut oil. I added the garlic and ginger to the onion and then stirred it. Then I added all of the spices until they were bloomed. Then I added some tomato sauce until combined and added about a cup of coconut milk. I let them all simmer for about 20 mins while I roasted some cauliflower. After 20 mins, I blended the sauce together and simmered some kale in it for about 10 mins, stirring frequently. I finished it with some lime juice, paratha on the side, and lots of cilantro on top.
