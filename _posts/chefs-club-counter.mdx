### Supreme Burger
![Supreme Burger](/blog/chefs-club-counter.jpg)


I wanted to come here for the breakfast sandwiches, but unfortunately I was too late, so I settled for a burger. The burger menu was pretty large, as far as burger menus go. I asked the person at the counter for her recommendation and she said to go for the supreme burger. A pretty straight forward burger:

Beef, Cheese, Special Sauce, Lettuce, Onions, Pickles, Sesame Bun.

Overall, it was pretty good, it just wasn't worth $15. This burger tasted like a classic diner burger, but to pay $15 bucks for a diner burger is 3x more expensive than it should be. If a burger is going to cost that much, it better be the best burger I've ever had.
