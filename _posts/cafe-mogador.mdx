### Moroccan Benedict
![Moroccan Benedict](/blog/cafe-mogador.jpg)

For $18 you get a beautiful Mediterranean breakfast; eggs benedict (I got mine with this wonderful middle-eastern tomato sauce), a cup of ginger tea, and a glass of orange juice. The eggs benedict was perfect, it had a great hollaindaise sauce on top of a toasted english muffin, with a perfectly poached egg. On the side were some greens and some of the best breakfast potatoes I've had. The potatoes were creamy on the inside, and just a little bit crispy on the outside. Normally I like very crispy on the outside, but because the inside was really smooth and warm, it was perfect. This is the first time I was able to get in, the line is normally an hour wait, so if you go prepare to wait and be happy you may not have to.
