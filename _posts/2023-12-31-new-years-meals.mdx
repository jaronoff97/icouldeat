# Keeping it casual

New years is one of my favorite events, I love being surrounded by close friends and enjoying some nice wine together. This year, I didn't want to go too over the top so I made yakitori and carl made latkes that we had leftover from Hannukah.

## Simple Yakitori

I followed [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZs_MPrvp8) to breaking down chicken for yakitori which is a bit different than my usual method. The first chicken I did was a bit rough, but the second went much more smoothly. For the skewers, I stuck to the easier parts for this dinner as this was more for sustinance than flavor. This meant, breast, tenderlion, and thigh were the main events. I threw in a few belly and skin skewers too, but that was pretty much it. From there, I broiled them in the oven one sheet tray at a time (three trays in all) and finished them by dipping in a thin (maybe too thin) tare mixture. This yielded some juicy and flavorful skewers. I kept some trays in the oven at 200 F as guests arrived, taking them out and plating them when people were hungry.
