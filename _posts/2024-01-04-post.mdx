# Sauteed Beans

![bean and rice](/blog/2024-01-04-bean.jpg)

This is a formulaic bean recipe based on [this from seriouseats](https://www.seriouseats.com/warm-spanish-style-giat-bean-salad-recipe). The gist of it is to just sautee some veg in oil, add some spices, sautee, add beans, finish with vinegar and profit.

I served that over some of the leftover rice from the day before which I fried as a pancake and flipped (well mostly flipped, some ended up on the ground :/.)

# Cauliflower Mole Paratha Taco

I made some rich mole a few months ago that was sitting in the freezer, so I heated that up and poured it over some well roasted cauliflower florets. Florets were done at varying temps in the oven because I couldn't make up my mind, but it probably ended up being 400F for about 20 mins. I had some leftover leeks and celery that I blanched and then shocked in an ice bath. Once those were mostly done, I pan-fried some vegan paratha I got from kalustyan's. I put it together almost like a stuffed taco – paratha, cauliflower, leek, mole, garnish with some parsley. We then added some of the aforementioned beans at the table which went super well! The mole was rich and had a good bitterness to offset the sweetness of the cauli and acid from the beans.
