### Avocado Sandwich
![Avocado Sandwich](/blog/mud-spot.jpg)

For the price, this place is totally worth it. $19 for any dish on their menu, beer/mimosa, and Oj/ coffee. I got the avocado sandwich, because I was trying to be a bit healthier with my choices, but it was still really good. I think overall it would have been made a bit better by a more flavorful addition to offset the mildness / texture of the avocado. There were a bunch of over things on the menu, though, that sounded amazing. I'm excited to try it again.

Rating: 7.5/10, probably going to be higher with a second visit.
