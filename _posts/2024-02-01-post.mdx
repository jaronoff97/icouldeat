# Pizza night

We've both been craving pizza and I've really been missing Picco. So this was a pan pizza to maybe make up for it. I did this two nights in a row, the first night I slightly under baked it, so the second night I baked it without the sauce on and it was farrr better. For the pizza, I used the leftover sauce from the papparadelle, added some vegan labneh, some sauteed and seared brocolli rabe and topped with some chives.

# Pierogi night

Using the last bit of that bolognese, I made a simple pierogi dough with some flour, vegan butter, and warm water. I then let it rest, rolled it out and then we both filled them up. I did a simple pan fry, boil, and fry again.

# Soup night

Finally, I saw [this recipe](https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/tunisian-spiced-chickpea-and-bread-soup-lablabi) on youtube, seemed simple enough so I decided to make it tonight. I made a few changes though. Instead of harissa, I added in some chilis in adobo, some zaatar, some celery, and finally instead of just pouring over some bread I added some bread as it simmered to thicken. Towards the end of the cook time, I removed some of the solids (chickpea, garlic, celery) and blended the soup with an immersion blender for a better texture and wow. This was really incredible. I garnished with a dollop of vegan sour cream, plenty of cilantro, some fried shallots and garlic oil. Really spicy but kind of addictive.
