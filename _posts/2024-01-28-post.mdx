Luckily, Katie is feeling better so this past week was a bit easier. That meant it was back to veganuary.

# rigatoni

This was a very simple rigatoni in a similar sauce to that vodka sauce from a few weeks ago. I sauteed some shallots, added some spices, then added some tomato sauce. I added some vodka and then blended it together.

# peanut-soup

A [fantastic seriouseats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/west-african-inspired-vegan-peanut-sweet-potato-soup-recipe) per usual. I think I got the wrong sweet potato (korean white yam not a yellow one) but it didn't end up mattering. This was incredibly luscious, almost like a sauce. Topping it over the black rice resulted in a perfect nuttiness. I added a fair amount of lime juice which helped balance the richness and cut through.

Carl and I were both craving xidoufen. Xidoufen is this great chinese dish made from soaked and blended split peas. The last few times we've made it, it takes forever to cook down the blended peas in to a lava like soup. This recipe used besan (fine chickpea flour) and came together in minutes. We served this over some rice noodles and topped with a lot of accoutrements. I made: ginger water, garlic oil, fried garlic, mushrooms, and scallions. To eat, I mixed it all around until it was saucy.

# cortado

I've been working on my milk steaming and latte art and this was the first one I've done that I'm pretty proud of. Steaming oat milk is so challenging, and my coworker told me I don't have the right mug for making it easy to do the art.

# tofu

This was a very hearty meal – some pan seared marinated tofu over some farro with a kale caeser. The tofu we got wasn't firm enough and the sauce could have been a bit thicker, but otherwise this was great.

# gnocchi

![gnocchi](/blog/2024-01-28-gnocchi.jpg)

A simple thrown together gnocchi. I sauteed some brunoised shallot and garlic, added some cherry tomatoes and sake and cooked it down a bit. I cooked the gnocchi and added some of the water and half the gnocchi to the sauce. I then pan fried the other half of the gnocchi for some varied texture.

# pappardelle

On a friend's recommendation, I made [this vegan bolognese](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021916-vegan-bolognese-with-mushrooms-and-walnuts) and topped that on some pappardelle. It was perfectly saucy, hearty and velvety. I should have mixed more sauce with the pasta water, but it was fantastic regardless.
