This was a great spot to go to with friends; it was lively, the waiters were really nice, it had great music, and the food was awesome too! My friends and I split the truffle mac and cheese, which was amazing; very very rich though; and the tortelli prosciutto which was in a good white sauce (not too creamy) with some peas. Normally I'm not a huge fan of white sauces, but both of these were fantastic. The flavors, though, were a bit too mild for my taste, maybe it was just because I wasn't feeling such rich dishes, but I thought it could have been a bit better. If I go back I'll try something a bit more up my alley; bolognese.
