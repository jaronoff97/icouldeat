This place was amazing. I absolutely loved every part of this meal. For appetizers my friend and I split the bacon steak and the caeser salad. I've never had a bacon steak before, but this was unbelievable. It came with some maple syrup and it was perfect. The caeser was also really good, and provided some balance for the meal. For our main courses we each got a french dip, and a fried chicken & toast. The french dip had amazing beef, almost like roast beef, with some cheese, onions and a couple of other things. The coup de gras though was the french toast and chicken. It was better than the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. It was stacked high, and tasted as good as it looked (which can be hard to come by.) I'm gonna recommend this to a lotttt of people.
