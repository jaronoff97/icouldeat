### Bacon Egg and Cheese
![Bacon Egg and Cheese](/blog/brooklyn-bagel-company.jpg)

I had heard a lot about this being one of the best bagel places in NYC. Intrigued, I had to go try it out. I got a plain bagel, with BEC (bacon, egg, and cheese): the classic. Overall, it was pretty good; but not as good as my favorite bagel spot on 35th and 8th (Best Bagel and Coffee.) I think this might have been a better BEC, but the actual bagel itself wasn't as good. I think I'd go back and give it another try with just plain cream cheese as that normally makes it easier to just taste the bagel.

Rating 8/10
