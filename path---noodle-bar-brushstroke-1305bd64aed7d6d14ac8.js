The noodle bar itself was really cool; good decor, music was quiet, conversations were quiet too. We started off with some dumplings (wagyu beef and scallop) which were pretty good, but ehhh I wouldn’t get them again. The ramen though, really good! I got the “Brushstroke Tonkotsu Ramen”: Pork Chashu, Nitamago, Kikurage, Kyushu-Style 4-Day Boiled Pork Soup Ramen. It was fantastic; really great noodles, thin, and tasted more like dan dan noodles. The broth was great, thin and not too overpowing. I really liked each part of this ramen. It was a bit expensive, but unlike a lot of the other things I’ve had on this blog, totally worth it. I wouldn’t go so far to say this was the best ramen I’ve ever had, but it was definitely up there. My friend got the duck ramen, and gave me a little taste; it was really unique. It was a thick broth with amazing pork.</p>\n<p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Noodle Bar at Brushstroke",date:"January 16, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/noodle-bar-brushstroke/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/brooklyn-bagel-company/"},frontmatter:{title:"Brooklyn Bagel & Coffee Company"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/maison-pickle/"},frontmatter:{title:"Maison Pickle"}}}}}});
