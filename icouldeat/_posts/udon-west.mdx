### Niku Udon
![Niku Udon](/blog/udon-west.jpg)

Udon West is a small udon shop hidden on st marks between some of the bigger places like Kenka and Spot. Udon West boasts low prices for a large meal, which I always appreciate for NYC. This time around I got the Niku Udon, the traditional preperation for udon dishes. It was amazing. For less than $10 I got a huge bowl of udon, a handful of meat, and some scallions. My usual problem with udon is that the broth uses too much fish paste, causing a bit of a slimier flavoring, but this broth was very mild and didn't take away from the actual meal.
