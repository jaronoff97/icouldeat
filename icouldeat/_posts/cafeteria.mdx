### Roast Chicken
![Roast Chicken](/blog/cafeteria.jpg)

Cafeteria is a great place for comfort food in a pinch, it's always busy, but it doesn't take long to get a table. They have a bunch of great options on the menu, with some really good appetizers. I also like the ambiance, it's a good nosie level with really cool lighting. I've always enjoyed a solid meal like this one. The price is a bit much, but it makes a lot of sense for a restaurant like this in NYC.
