### Tonkotsu Ramen
![Tonkotsu Ramen](/blog/noodle-bar-brushstroke.jpg)

This was a really cool noodle bar; it was on the side of this VERY nice, expensive, famous japanese restaurant called Brushstroke. The noodle bar itself was really cool; good decor, music was quiet, conversations were quiet too. We started off with some dumplings (wagyu beef and scallop) which were pretty good, but ehhh I wouldn't get them again. The ramen though, really good! I got the "Brushstroke Tonkotsu Ramen": Pork Chashu, Nitamago, Kikurage, Kyushu-Style 4-Day Boiled Pork Soup Ramen. It was fantastic; really great noodles, thin, and tasted more like dan dan noodles. The broth was great, thin and not too overpowing. I really liked each part of this ramen. It was a bit expensive, but unlike a lot of the other things I've had on this blog, totally worth it. I wouldn't go so far to say this was the best ramen I've ever had, but it was definitely up there. My friend got the duck ramen, and gave me a little taste; it was really unique. It was a thick broth with amazing pork.
