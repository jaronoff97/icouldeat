### Mushroom Toast
![Mushroom Toast](/blog/tipsy-parson.jpg)

This may have been the best mushroom toast I've ever had. The perfectly cooked mushrooms were on top of some ricotta cheese and a great piece of toast. I'm not a huge fan of avocado toast, I think avocado is a good addition, but doesn't give enough flavor by itself. In this case though, the simple combo of the ricotta cheese, eggs, and mushrooms produced an absolutely amazing flavor. Chef's on youtube like to talk about meals that are greater than the sum of their parts, and this is definitely one of them. This is the kind of meal that I'm definitely going to be cooking at home for myself on a weekend.
